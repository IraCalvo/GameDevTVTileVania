# GameDevTVTileVania
GameDevTV Class

Within this class I learned how to use the more up to date and improved Unity built in input system. This a 2D platformer game that has the following features:
-Simple WASD movement
-Tiles that have different interactions with the player
-Simple Shooting method
-Game Objects that persist even after death
-Unique Camera system that plays specific camera's based on what the player is doing
-Camera system thats binded to specific parts of the map
-Simple 3 level Game Loop
-Classic enemy that follows platform rules
-Super basic SFX on collectables
-Animations!

While I was making this game I strengthened my already existing knowledge on movement, animations, tile palettes, and learned how to use the new Input System even more.
There were alot of things that I learned while creating this game, I learned about how to keep game object's states persist even after the player loses a life. I learned
about Rule Tiles where the tile will automatically "generate" and display the correct tile based on the rules and limatations you give each tile. Additionally I learned
about how to play specific camera's given on the player's state whether they are jumping, running, or even climbing a ladder, the correct camera will play according
to the player.
